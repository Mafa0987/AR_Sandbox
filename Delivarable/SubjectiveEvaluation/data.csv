","Have you previously participated in water-related initiatives/efforts like this one? ","How often do you engage with events related to environmental sustainability? ","How interested are you in learning more about water management or conservation practices? ","Have you ever used an Augmented Reality (AR), Virtual Reality (VR), or another type of immersive experience (IMX) before?","To what extent has your existing knowledge influenced your understanding of water reuse and symbiosis portrayed in the AR Sandbox?","Has your perception of the importance of water management practices changed after engaging with the AR Sandbox? ","The AR Sandbox environment responded well to my hand movements, allowing me to interact with the sandbox and manipulate the virtual terrain effectively. ","Using AR Sandbox with hand movement felt natural to me; for example, I could easily shape the terrain and observe changes based on my movements. ","I felt immersed in the gameplay while using AR Sandbox (for example, when sculpting the terrain or observing the effects of water flow). ","I felt comfortable using AR Sandbox with hand movement (for example, when using movements to add or remove water from the virtual environment). ","I felt like I had good control over what I did in AR Sandbox (for example, using movements to sculpt detailed landforms or control water flow). ","Time felt different than usual when I was using AR Sandbox (for example, it felt like time passed quickly). ","I am satisfied using AR Sandbox with hand movement (for example, using movements to interact with the sandbox and navigate the virtual environment). ","I had fun using AR Sandbox with hand movement; it was an exciting and engaging experience. ","I wanted to stay longer in AR Sandbox because it was exciting; I didn't want the experience to end. ","I felt confident using AR Sandbox with hand movement (for example, knowing how to effectively use movements to manipulate the virtual environment).","Overall, I think AR Sandbox with hand movement is a useful and practical way to learn about water systems and conservation practices. ","I liked AR Sandbox with hand movement and found it enjoyable (for example, it made learning about water effects in the ecosystem interactive). ","If I use AR Sandbox with hand movement again, I think I will understand it better (for example, becoming more proficient at using movements to interact with the virtual environment). ","What did you like about your experience using AR Sandbox with hand movement? ","What did you not like about your experience using AR Sandbox with hand movement? ","Do you have any ideas to improve the experience using AR Sandbox with hand movement? "
